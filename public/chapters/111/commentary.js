    "intro": "This surah is said to have been revealed in response to the Prophet’s uncle known by the nickname Abū Lahab meaning 'Father of Flame' because of his bright red complexion. One day the Prophet climbed one of the hills just outside of Makkah and yelled, 'Come to me!' the way one would call if an enemy were approaching. All the Quraysh gathered around and said, 'What ails you?' He replied, 'Were I to tell you that the enemy is going to attack you in the morning or in the evening, would you not believe me?' They said, 'Yes, for we have not found you telling anything other than the truth.' He said, 'In that case, I am a warner sent to you against a tremendous punishment.' Abū Lahab responded, 'Perished be your hands all this day. Is this why you have summoned all of us here?' Then God revealed the five verses of this sūrah.[SQ]",

        "meaning": "'What he has committed' could refer to the deeds he has done. The notion that ones deeds can be in vain is mentioned e.g. in verse 11:16. Others say that it refers to his children as it is reported that he has said: 'Even if what my nephew says is true, I will ransom myself … with my wealth and my children'.[SQ]",
